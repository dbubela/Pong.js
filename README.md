# Pong.js

the timeless classic pong built with HTML and JavaScript

**Note:** that the program was built with Brackets.io - which can be downloaded <a href="http://brackets.io/">HERE</a>

## LocalHost Instructions:
>Download and Install Brackets.io from the link above.  

>Clone repo for pong from "https://github.com/dbubela/Pong.js.git". 

>Right click folder and select 'open as brackets project'. 

>Select "lightning bolt" icon in top right of Brackets window. 

>Begin the game and test your skills against the simple bot! 

**Note:** User(Left side) paddles are controlled with mouse movement 

There is also a file named 'pong workflow'... which is the summation of my raw workflow and train of thought from conception to creation. 

**Note:** This is an absolute dumpsterfire - It's easy to lose yourself in this labrynth
